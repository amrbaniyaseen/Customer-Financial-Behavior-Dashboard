# Customer Financial Behavior Dashboard â€“ Power BI  

This is my **first end-to-end project in Power BI**, where I built an interactive dashboard to analyze customer financial behavior.  

## Key Insights

- Transaction Percentiles (25th, 50th, 75th)  
- Error Rate & Debt/Income Ratio  
- Gender, Age Group, and Card Type distributions  

## Tech Stack  
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Star Schema  
- Bi-Directional Filtering
